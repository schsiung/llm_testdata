 * CWE: 129 Improper Validation of Array Index
 * BadSource: random Set data to a random value
 * GoodSource: A hardcoded non-zero, non-min, non-max, even number
 * Sinks: array_read_check_min
 *    GoodSink: Read from array after verifying that data is at least 0 and less than array.length
 *    BadSink : Read from array after verifying that data is at least 0 (but not verifying that data less than array.length)
 * Flow Variant: 51 Data flow: data passed as an argument from one function to another in different classes in the same package
